3 different implementations of the dining philosopher problem for CPSC 261 at UBC.

phil.c compiles and runs but deadlocks. Note that it was an exercise for class and it was meant to deadlock. The next two files are two working versions.

phil-ordered.c is an implementation where the philosophers always pick up the same forks in the same order.

phil-random.c is the same except the order is randomly selected.
